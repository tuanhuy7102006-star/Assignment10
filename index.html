    <h2>About the Game</h2>
<p>
  -- Minecraft is a popular sandbox video game where players can explore,
  build, and survive in an open world made entirely out of blocks.
  The game was created by Mojang Studios and has become one of the
  best-selling video games of all time.
</p>
<p>
  --  One of the main reasons Minecraft is so successful is because it allows
  players to express creativity without limits. Players can design simple
  houses, large cities, complex machines using Redstone, or even recreate
  real-world locations. The game also helps develop important skills such as
  problem-solving, planning, and teamwork when playing with others online.
</p>
<p>
  -- Minecraft is used not only for entertainment but also for educational
  purposes in schools. Teachers use Minecraft to help students learn coding,
  architecture, history, and collaboration. This makes it both fun and
  educational in a school-appropriate way.
</p>

<h2>Game Modes</h2>
<p>
  -- Minecraft offers different game modes so that players can choose how they
  want to experience the game. Each mode provides a different style of
  gameplay depending on whether the player prefers creativity, challenge,
  or storytelling.
